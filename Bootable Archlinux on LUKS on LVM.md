* I have an old Samsung 640GB external desk. I bought it 15 years ago as external storage and never actively used it
* I thought of setting up Linux on it, attach to an old laptop and run it as home server
* So I need to make sure:
  * I can extend storage over time with more disks when I need to: LVM
  * Encrypt the data : LUKS

I'm following two guides:

* https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_LVM
