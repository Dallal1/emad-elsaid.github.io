Hi, This is my :sunflower:  [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). It's a public space. It includes notes, ideas and experiments. Anything I'm involved in will be part of this garden.

I'm a [software engineer](</Why I became a software developer>) backend focused. I mainly use #Ruby and #Go.

# Social profiles

*  [GitHub](https://www.github.com/emad-elsaid) have all my sideprojects. it's one of my hobbies.
* [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/emad__elsaid) will have my random ideas of photographs. 
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/emad.elsaid.hamed) for me is more about connecting to family and egyptian devs community
* [Youtube](http://youtube.com/EmadElsaid) include videos about book reviews or gameplays or even some thoughts about software engineering. 
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emadelsaid) I keep my professional profile updated as much as possible
* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/internalerr) streams used to be fun for a while. I may get back to it
* [Keybase](https://keybase.io/emadelsaid) can be used to send me encrypted messages if you're seeking confidentiality.

# Sideprojects

I write sideprojects in my spare time. my interest changes over time. The following are projects I'm involved in right now or in operation without development: 

* Mau : a convention for building P2P Web 2 applications 
* Who is popular today ? : a project that collects news and people pages from wikipedia and cross link them together.
* Xlog : Personal knowledgebase server and it's what generates this blog
* [Golang Debugger](https://github.com/emad-elsaid/debugger) : a GUI interface for Delve #go debugger
* [Library](https://github.com/emad-elsaid/library) : a simpler solution than Goodreads to manage [my books](https://library.emadelsaid.com/users/0c731704-073d-4433-b38b-1dc912f7046c)

It's built using Xlog from markdown [repository hosted on Github](https://github.com/emad-elsaid/emad-elsaid.github.io). And it uses no Javascript. except for 2 lines that allow Right-To-Left (RTL) pages to be displayed in the correct direction.

If you find issues or typos I will be thankful if you went to the repository and edit the file and open a pull request with the changes.
