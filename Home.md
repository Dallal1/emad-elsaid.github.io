Hi, This is my :sunflower:  [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). It's my public space. It includes notes, ideas and experiments. Anything I'm involved in will be part of this garden.

I'm a [software engineer](</Why I became a software developer>) backend focused. I mainly use #Ruby and #Go.

# Social profiles

* I like to work on side projects. you'll find a list of them on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/emad-elsaid)
* Sometimes I'll tweet random ideas on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/emad__elsaid)
* Or write stories or fun anecdotes on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/emad.elsaid.hamed)
* Also sometimes I make youtube videos, book reviews or gameplays or even some thoughts about software engineering on [Youtube](http://youtube.com/EmadElsaid)
* I'm not active on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emadelsaid) but I keep my profile updated as much as possible
* I used to stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/internalerr) for a while. I may get back to it

# My Hobbies

* :keyboard: Programming  
	- #Ruby : The main language I'm using daily for the past years
    - #Go : Learned it around 2018 and it's been my favorite language. and gradually switching to it
    - #Javascript : I used it since I learned how to code, I use it exclusively in the browser and when it's needed
    - #CPP : I'm interested in keeping a moderate skill to use C++ it keeps me close to the low level techinicalities
    - #Elisp: I have a pretty basic level of command for Emacs Lisp as I'm using Emacs on daily basis and extended it with some features for my needs

# Sideprojects

I write sideprojects in my spare time. my interest changes over time. The following are projects I'm involved in right now or in operation without development: 

* Mau : a convention for building P2P Web 2 applications 
* Who is popular today ? : a project that collects news and people pages from wikipedia and cross link them together.
* Xlog : Personal knowledgebase server and it's what generates this blog
* Golang Debugger : a GUI interface for Delve #go debugger
* [Library](https://github.com/emad-elsaid/library) : That's my physical library I built it to have a simpler solution than Goodreads. less bloated and where I can control it

It's built using Xlog from markdown [repository hosted on Github](https://github.com/emad-elsaid/emad-elsaid.github.io). And it uses no Javascript. except for 2 lines that allow Right-To-Left (RTL) pages to be displayed in the correct direction.

If you find issues or typos I will be thankful if you went to the repository and edit the file and open a pull request with the changes.
