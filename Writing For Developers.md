# Introduction 

- This is a response for Ahmed Alfy [video on Facebook](https://fb.watch/hP_2R6RN4b/)
- The video talks about writing good articles for developers and pitfalls when giving advice online
- This is a checklist for developers when writing technical articles
- This represents the preference of the document authors and shouldn't be taken as a fact

# Style preferences

- We prefer a **today I learned** (TIL) format over **advice from a professional** format
- We try to keep a **looking for feedback** attitude
- We exercise caution when giving a generalized advice

# Before Writing

- Read related material on the topic
- In case of opinions read opposing opinions

# Writing

- We clarify opinions from facts
- We clarify the context, audience, and scope

# After Writing

- Correct typos and grammar mistakes
- Seek reviews from others
