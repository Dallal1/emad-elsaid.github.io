# General notes

- [The first page to learn GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) doesn't make any sense.
  - The code introduced in this page doesn't tell anything about what does it come from, which is part of GraphQL and what's part of the programming langauge
 - My stand from GraphQL was that it is flexible, but the flexibility introduces less control over queries. so improving queries is extermely hard
