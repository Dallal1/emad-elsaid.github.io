I had this phone for around a year or so. I liked the idea of retractable selfie camera as I don't use it often. the screen and Mi UI was beautiful. 

Unfortunately it got damaged after cycling with it under the rain. The screen turned off and never turned on again although the phone itself turns on and the audio is working and I believe the touch is also working. :disappointed:
