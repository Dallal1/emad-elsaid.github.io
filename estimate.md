* I'm using [Planning Poker online](https://planningpokeronline.com/) at work for estimation
* After a couple of sessions it asks for a subscription
* I would like to self host a free solution
* I already had a project called [estimate](https://github.com/emad-elsaid/estimate) which is written on Ruby
* I had this estimate project deployed on heroku when they had a free tier
* I would like to host it on my VPS for personal use
* This is a good opportunity to rewrite it in C and learn how to write a simple web application in C

# Findings
* There is a GNU project that offers an HTTP library: [Libmicrohttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/)
