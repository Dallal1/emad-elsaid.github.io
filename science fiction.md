I grew with science finction books, small novels calls pocket novellas. the only arabic series of novellas that I could find was "Future files" small serialized books written by "Nabil Farouk" a famous egyptian writer. I have read all of them.

Probably one of the reasons I think so much about the future is that present time sucks. I wanted a world with flying cars, teleportation and clean air and instead I got slow internet and barely working public transportation growing up that was probably a catalyst for my fixation on the future. 

**Isaac Asimov** and **Liu Cixin** ideas are very fascinating to me. they paint the future, look at the world from different perspective. I love their novels.
