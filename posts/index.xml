      <description>What do we have? In this article I will assume we have a ruby on rails application that is using a database to store some data, and capistrano for deployment and you want to deploy in on your server but instead of deploying directly on your server you want to dockerize the whole project to give it a separate environment and keep it away from your other applications.
Why do we dockerize a rails application?</description>

      <description>I started using emacs couple weeks ago and i have to say that i&amp;rsquo;m amazed by how this editor is working, Emacs VS VIM war isn&amp;rsquo;t coming from nowhere after all.
one thing that annoys me is that i stopped blogging for a long time, if you checked the last blog post, it&amp;rsquo;s been a year since the last one.
so I had an idea, what if i made blogging more comforting for me?</description>

      <description>yesterday i faced a problem with my rails application, my models was as follows
class Vehicle &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base MOVABLES = [:car, :bus, :plane] belongs_to :movable, polymorphic: true, dependent: :destroy, required: true, autosave: true accepts_nested_attributes_for :movable end  class Car &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_one :vehicle, dependent: :destroy, as: :movable end  class Bus &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_one :vehicle, dependent: :destroy, as: :movable end  class Plane &amp;lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_one :vehicle, dependent: :destroy, as: :movable end  so, when i try to create a Veihcle with nested attributes for the movable it complain with error &amp;ldquo;are you trying to build a polymorphic relation?</description>
