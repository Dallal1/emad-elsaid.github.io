# General impression

- Nice design
- Contact on the face was comfortable for short periods
- Longer periods can leave pressure points marks on the cheeks
- Image is clear and the latency is very low
- It's impressive to set it up for the first time. dialogs and menus float in front of your face
- The controllers are very responsive to movement
- Didn't experience heating, even when it heats up I notice only when I take it off my face in my palms not on the face
- It's heavy on the front side, I guess that was solved for the Pro version making it a more balanced
- Without my glasses I noticed some text glowing the further it is from the center of the screen
- I added the raiser that comes with it to help keep my glasses while using it
- With my glasses the glowing is reduced but still not very sharp

# Standalone 

- The device works for around 2 to 2:30 hours on battery
- Controllers uses 1 AA battery each
- Device turns off after 15 seconds of inactivity and turn on when you put it on your face
- Device will turn off screen after you take it off your face and putting it on again will reset you position in whatever app you're using
- The Desktop equivelant in VR is a room, default room for me was a place on open area, sandy and mountains and other places (Villas) far away. You get to change it from different presets.
- You can't move in that space (teleportation) you have to move in real space to move yourself in VR space (the PC version had teleportation)
- I choose a space station place and I felt very comfortable there. although the graphics are not very realistic but it was a beautiful experience to sit in a space station looking on a planet and other spaceships are moving around.
- Until I get to move in the place and look out of the window to find that the planet is clipped from under that window (I guess it's an optimization)
- controlling where windows will appear and move the home bar around still doesn't feel natural but better experience than the PC experience with the Quest app
- TV app and Youtube 360 videos are very impressive I get to experience a video of sky diving, and another about Coral reefs.
- I didn't experience nausea or dizziness.
- The only app that made me dizzy is an app of roller coasters. After the tutorial I felt very dizzy. won't try it again.
- Tried VR Chat. very weird place.
- You can turn on hand guestures so you get to use fingers to click on buttons or scroll in menus

# With PC

- I was able to install Quest app on PC (windows version only)
- The app can pair with the device over Wifi or with a Cable (I only tried it over Wifi)
- Pairing introduces a speaker in the system to switch audio to the headset
- The standalone software get replaced by another experience rendered from the PC so I get dropped in a different space and different menus. it's like the device has an OS that gets nullified by the desktop app replacing everything with a feed rendered from my PC over WIFI
- The resolution is lower than the standalone experience
- the latency is a bit noticeable especially when another device is using WIFI for youtube for example. frames are droped and interactions sometimes doesn't register.
- Tried Elite Dangerous in VR mode. was impressive to sit in a spaceship and look around, very different gaming experience
- Got dizzy and nauseous after 30 minutes of gameplay
- I get to cast the PC screen to VR space and control the mouse with VR controllers. I don't feel it's practical yet.
- I guess I'll stick to the stand-alone experience.

# Bundle

- After activating the device I received an email from Meta to claim a free version of Beat saber
- Played couple levels I loved it. although I wasn't interested in trying it out but after I did, I guess that's my favorite app so far

# Take aways

- It feels good to be in a 3D space looking around
- High refresh rate and low latency is very important for me personally to not get nausea.
- I still can't use it to code in VR
- Graphics is still not realisting although it's good enough to feel good
- I'm skeptic after it's practicality right now. but I expect in couple of years this should catch up to the PC graphics realism.
