I always wanted to play chess, it seems always hard to me to win a game, and I NEVER WON, even when i'm playing with a level 1 computer AI opponent.

Couple weeks ago i decided to re-learn chess, and as i discover something new i'll update this post, every video, article and resource i'll read will be added in here.

## The platform ##

first thing i was searching for is a FREE platform to play chess, and by "platform" i mean a website, mobile apps for oth android and iphone and a good community and maybe some learning resource that help kick me in the game.

I found couple websites

1. [Chess.com](http://www.chess.com)
2. [Chessfriends.com](http://www.chessfriends.com/)
3. [lichess.org](http://en.lichess.org/)

i also found other website that i won't mention because i really don't even remember them.

## Learning material ##

chess.com has a really good [youtube chennel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5kS0l76kC0xOzMPtOmSFGw) for that, but it's kind of not sufficient for me.

also i found another chennel for a good player who dedicate his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KebuChess) for chess only.

this is a [list of the videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgzPmh9gYq1mYq8c7WFV4bwgNHL_e2A6w) i watched just right before i start writing this blog post, and it will be updated with any video i'll watch about chess.

also there are a lot of videos on lichess.org [here](http://en.lichess.org/video/M624T3PTggU?)

## learning websites: ##

1. [thechesswebsite.com](http://www.thechesswebsite.com/)
2. [all lectures of GM Varuzhan Akobian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVWaFpMwtaGguNTCmp2fAFJxhKi0JEpp6)

## What i learnt so far about the game  ##

1. Game has phases just like League of legends game
   1. Early game which is called "Opening"
   2. Middle game which is called the same
   3. Late game which is called "The end game"
2. Chess material has weight for each piece and you should be making good trade of your material with your enemy material.
3. each piece position has a potential which is how many square can it move to currently.
4. there are a ready made openings and it is named like rubik's cube solving methods, and each opening has variations with advantage and disadvantages for each.
