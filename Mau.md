Mau is the result of my frustration with the centralized web2 applications models we have now I expressed these ideas initially in a couple of notes: 

- A general idea of a peer to peer social network
- Follow up on peer to peer social media network solution 
- Sound approach for a p2p social network which falls back to current web 


Then I went on and tried to document a more comprehensive document expressing this approach and implementing a proof of concept with #go . The project is hosted on [github/mau-network/mau](https://github.com/mau-network/mau)
