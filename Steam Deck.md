#devices

I got my steam deck 21-September-2022 as my 34th birthday gift. 

* The steam deck I got was the 512GB version. 
* It came with a hard case, microfiber cloth, a charger and a pouch bag for the charger.

# Games 

I played several games on it and I noticed that it's easier decision to buy a game after I got it.

* Portal 2
* The witcher 3
* Dead cells
* Hades
* Cup head
* TMNT
* Skul
* Vampire surivors
* Brotato
* Celeste
* Yakuza 0

# Build

Material and build quality feels very good. it also feels good in the hand more like a PS4 controller feeling than xbox controller.

# Performance 

* Some games really get on it's nerves, the witcher 3 for example. the fan kicks in after couple minutes of gameplay
* Some games plays really smooth and doesn't make it sweat. Dead cells for example.
* I tried to install an epic game from the desktop mode "Nioh" and it struggled with it and the experience awful it didn't regognize the correct controller layout even. so I sticked to steam games.
* I got to install google chrome and play youtube videos that was cool.

# Game library

It felt good that I got a game on steam deck then I played it also on my PC. I got TMNT and then found that it can be played split screen so it felt good that I can just run same game with same save history to let my wife join on a bigger screen.
