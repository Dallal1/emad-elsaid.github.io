I'm one of the Faculty of computer and informatics Suez Canal University 2011 Alumni. And thought maybe what the faculty offers can be documented digitally for self-studying. or even for reviewing what we studied after years of graduation. The list is based off of the [official website](http://ci.suez.edu.eg/edulife.html) curriculum list I believe this list is different slightly from what I studied back in my time.

The faculty offers a 4 year program for a bachelor degree.

# Courses Missing from the list
The faculty used to have some courses that were removed in favor of other apparently. the following are courses that I studied but I can't find them on the list of this years curriculum
1. Partial Differential Equations (PDE)

# TODO
- [ ] Clarify items with (?) in front of them as the Arabic name doesn't reflect the content
- [ ] Add links to Wikipedia pages
- [ ] Add textbook reference for all subjects
- [ ] Add YouTube courses for all subjects
