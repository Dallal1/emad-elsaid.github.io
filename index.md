Hi, This is my digital garden. It'll include my public posts, ideas and experiments. Anything I'm involved in will be part of this garden.

I'm a software engineer.

* Back-end focused. I mainly work with Ruby and Go.
* I like to work on side projects. you'll find a list of them on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/emad-elsaid)
* Sometimes I'll tweet random ideas on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/emad__elsaid)
* Or write stories or fun anecdotes on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/emad.elsaid.hamed)
* Also sometimes I make youtube videos, book reviews or gameplays or even some thoughts about software engineering on [Youtube](http://youtube.com/EmadElsaid)
* I'm not active on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emadelsaid) but I keep my profile updated as much as possible
* I used to stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/internalerr) for a while. I may get back to it
* And if you're on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/emadelsaid) you can send me encrypted messages if you're seeking confidentiality.

I post here some notes and ideas that may or may not be practical but it interests me and I wish other people find it interesting.
