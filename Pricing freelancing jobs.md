# Strategy
+ Choose a unit of measurement
+ Price per unit
  + Time (Hours, Days, Months)
  + Pages/Screens
+ Price as low as it gets you the job for your first job
+ Get jobs as much as your capacity
+ Increase the price gradually to get higher-quality jobs

# Show off your jobs
+ Show off on social media your finished jobs
+ Add small details that make you distinct

# Be precise and punctual
+ Be precise about the contract:
  + Expected deliverables
  + Expected deadline
  + Expected milestones
  + Expected installments
+ Write your contract down and communicate any changes in writing

# Not what I do while I should
+ Survey to know the competition pricing

# Problems
+ People changing the contract verbally
+ People not paying or delaying payment
+ People extending requirements after delivery
+ Extreme pricing negotiation
+ Assuming contract terms like support
