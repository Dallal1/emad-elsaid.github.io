* Crystal is an interesting language to me
* It's similar to ruby
* It has a large standard library
* and as I understand it's an LLVM frontend
* the problem for me is that if I need to write a program in ruby syntax I use Ruby. and If I want to write a program with simple syntax and fast runtime I would use Go
* So I'm now not sure when to use crystal
* The last time I used Crystal to solve one of project euler problems. my program had an overflowing integer. while running it with ruby was correct but slow. crystal program was just spinning and burning CPU cycles.
* So I'm still not sure if I should put the time and try it again. especially that the standrad library has many modules that can be useful to avoid dependency hell in other languages. even Go
