* Started to test MacOS on a MacBookPro M1 to see if I can adapt MacOS to my preference
* Corporate applications were easily found and installed
  * Logitech MX master mouse scroll didn't work properly until I installed their software
  * Davinci Resolve is already on the app store
  * Remarkable2 application just works
* Opensource software suffered a bit
  * Emacs first installation with brew didn't install the GUI version I had to add `--cask` flag
  * GPG integration with emacs was a nightmare. I had to install another software to show the password dialog
  * KeePassXC crashed twice when raising the window from hiding state
  * Syncthing worked perfectly
* Customizing the UI was horrible
  * Can't remove window shadow
  * Can't remove window decoration
  * Power software wasn't in the appstore (Amthyst, TinkerTool)
  * Can't remove the dock bar
  * Can't remove the swipe animation
* Connecting my Lenovo USBC dock worked for the monitor and charging. Keyboard and mouse didn't work until I restarted the laptop.
* Changing the external monitor to HDR made the monitor flicker and then turn off. it took a bit to turn off the flag as disconnecting and connecting again made the screen turn off after some flickering. so I had to race the flickering.
* The email application worked but notification didn't appear if I quit the application. so it doesn't have daemon in the background?
