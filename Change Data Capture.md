- Wikipedia page describe a vague design pattern when change can be signaled or captured to do an action https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture
- Probably the more familiar part of it to me are the rails libraries that can keep older versions of the data bafore change like [paper_trail](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail) gem.
