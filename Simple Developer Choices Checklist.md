* A list of choices that can simplify my life as a developer
* It also make other developers life easier when interacting with my software


# Project names
* Choose simple name 
* a Name that reflect what the project solves
* Plain name instead of marketing

Examples:
* Library (a project to manage my physical bookshelf)
* Debugger (a Golang debugger interface)
* Go-Server (golang server common code)

Avoid names like:
* Mau (social application concept) : too thematic
* Xlog (static site generator, and note taking)
* Amun (Emacs implementation in Ruby)


# Dependencies
* Avoid depending on multiple programming languages in the same project
* Avoid depending on packages that has other dependencies
* Avoid depending on third-party packages as much as possible

# Code naming
* in Golang prefer flat structure instead of nesting package
* Prefer one or two word classes/struct names instead of long names


# Code complexity 
* Avoid writing unneded abstractions unless it serves the function or it's reused
* Reduce the code to the minimum that covers the usecase
* Sacrifice minimal project features if it leads to greater simplicity in the project code
