* When going through the contribution guide for Go, You'll be asked to sign a contribution agreement
* If you're logged in with many google accounts the page will use the first account and there is no way to change it
* The trick is to add the account number to the URL. so add `&authuser=1` to the end of the URL where 1 is for me the second account I logged in with. change it until you see the correct email over the form
