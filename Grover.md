+ I used it to try Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest Pro VR headsets
+ Choosing devices is really easy
+ Devices arrives in couple days after requesting it
+ Devices are new in original packaging just like buying them new
+ I rented each device for 1 month but subscription appear in the app as if it'll continue until I return
+ Before the next subscription
  + I request the DHL return label print it
  + Erase the device data (factory reset)
  + Remove the device from my online accounts (meta devices list on my meta.com account)
  + repackage it in the original packaging and reseal the grover package
  + stick the return label
+ For Meta Quest 2 I returned it to DHL office and it took 2 days for the app to pause the subscription
+ For Meta Quest Pro I returned it to DHL station and it took around 1 day for the app to pause the subscription
+ It takes couple days (almost a week) for the device to be removed from the list on the grover app
+ Grover mobile app (android) is a slow and needs more care to address some usability issues
+ Overall I'm pleased with my experience and I would use it again for any expensive devices I would like to try before buying.
