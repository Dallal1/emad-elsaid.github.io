# Important notes

> Toll-Free Short Code
> NTRA has launched a toll-free short code (*155#) to help citizens
inquire about or cancel subscription to Value-Added Services (VASs).
Services include the entertainment services provided by MNOs for daily
or monthly subscription, such as promotional contests, news and sports
services, digital games, or any other entertainment service. The code
was launched after monitoring usersâ€™ complaints, including subscription
to a service without user consent, and service cost increase. The code
can be used by any MNO customer, free of charge, to inquire about
or cancel services without the need to search for codes or cancelation
means for each service separately
