:eyeglasses: #VR #Devices 

* I tried Meta Quest Pro after using Meta Quest 2 for 2 weeks

# Impression

* The design is way more premium
* The passthrough camera is colored although I expected it to be more clear, it's still very noisy but colorful
* The device lets the light from the below the eyes and I thought that will bother me but it didn't
* The lenses are more clear and the focus is better. not blurry on the edges like the Meta Quest 2
* Controllers vibrations feels better and the trigger feels smoother
* Colors feels more saturated. UI colors shows different on the Quest Pro I noticed it especially in the dialogs
