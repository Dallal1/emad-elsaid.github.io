The following is a research for the minimum requirement to have Xlog alow following the user from mastodon

* From any account on a mastodon instance tried to search for `@emad@whoispopulartoday.com` the logs were the following

```
W, [2022-11-28T02:24:29.325631 #9]  WARN -- : Exception (ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound) while processing https://whoispopulartoday.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:emad@whoispopulartoday.com for http.rb/5.1.0 (Mastodon/4.0.2; +https://toot.community/)
W, [2022-11-28T02:24:29.482088 #13]  WARN -- : Exception (ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound) while processing https://whoispopulartoday.com/.well-known/host-meta for http.rb/5.1.0 (Mastodon/4.0.2; +https://toot.community/)
```

* When I request https://toot.community/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:emad__elsaid@toot.community to check what should the response be this is what I got

```json
{
  "subject": "acct:emad__elsaid@toot.community",
  "aliases": [
    "https://toot.community/@emad__elsaid",
    "https://toot.community/users/emad__elsaid"
  ],
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page",
      "type": "text/html",
      "href": "https://toot.community/@emad__elsaid"
    },
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "type": "application/activity+json",
      "href": "https://toot.community/users/emad__elsaid"
    },
    {
      "rel": "http://ostatus.org/schema/1.0/subscribe",
      "template": "https://toot.community/authorize_interaction?uri={uri}"
    }
  ]
}
```

* Which I understand that it's part of the finger protocol https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033

* Requesting https://toot.community/.well-known/host-meta returned xml file

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<XRD xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0">
  <Link rel="lrdd" template="https://toot.community/.well-known/webfinger?resource={uri}"/>
</XRD>
```

* Added these files to xlog repo on github https://github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog/commit/30db7caac07f262ed195114a27bf72af186a3fb4
* this repo deploys to xlog.emadelsaid.com
* trying the follow `@xlog@xlog.emadelsaid.com` still didn't show anything. I thought maybe it crawls `/@xlog` and can't find anyting. my profile on toot.community has a link tag. maybe that's it

```html
<link href='https://toot.community/users/emad__elsaid' rel='alternate' type='application/activity+json'>
```

* Crawling the link `curl -H"Accept: application/activity+json" https://toot.community/users/emad__elsaid` returns this json. which is an activity streams person https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core

* Added the file after cleanup to github repo https://github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog/commit/5627dbea0c60f87c08d98cab00d1fd8a9ec378cc
* Still nothing
* I checked the code and it hits `host-meta` only if there is a problem fetching `webfinger` so removing `host-meta` shouldn't be a problem
* used ngrok locally and wrote an extension that handle these two files instead of static files and it worked

* clicking the item shows the profile

* So far after some improvements it worked https://github.com/emad-elsaid/xlog/commit/d2730ad1a862e7eedf0fdf2d732b14ab44e86884
* Here is the profile appearing on Mastodon https://toot.community/@Emad@www.emadelsaid.com
* And here is the configuration https://github.com/emad-elsaid/emad-elsaid.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/xlog.yml#L41
* The mastodon blog post about implementing basic activitypub server explains a lot of things well. I wish I have seen it first before the struggle https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/
