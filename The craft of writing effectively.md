* Stop thinking about rules and start thinking about readers
* Writing is a tool for thinking
  * Thinking and writing are not separate processes
  * You generate the text while you're thinking
* Your writing helped you think. 
  * This is different than how your readers expect to read
  * Readers: slow down, reread, they don't understand, they stop
* If your readers dont NEED to read it they'll stop
* Your teachers were paid to read your writing
* Readers after school period read because they think text is valuable to THEM
* Writing needs to be: 
  * Clear
  * Organized
  * Persuasive
  * Most importantly: Valuable
* Value is about readers not the content
  * Some readers will value your writing and other group will think it's useless
* Text should show why it's important
* no body cares what's inside of your head unless they're paid to care
* Writing is not communicating your ideas to your readers
  * It's changing their ideas
  * Nobody cares what ideas you have
* Your work is not new or original. it's vaulable work.
  * You're not here to create new knowledge. but valuable knowledge.
* Every community has code. set of words that communicate value
  * Know the code to make your text persuasive
