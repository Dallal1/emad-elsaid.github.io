The lecture is about academic writing. However it is also useful in technical writing for developers

* Stop thinking about rules and start thinking about readers
* Writing is a tool for thinking
  * Thinking and writing are not separate processes
  * You generate the text while you're thinking
* Your writing helped you think. 
  * This is different than how your readers expect to read
  * Readers: slow down, reread, they don't understand, they stop
* If your readers dont NEED to read it they'll stop
* Your teachers were paid to read your writing
* Readers after school period read because they think text is valuable to THEM
* Writing needs to be: 
  * Clear
  * Organized
  * Persuasive
  * Most importantly: Valuable
* Value is about readers not the content
  * Some readers will value your writing and other group will think it's useless
* Text should show why it's important
* no body cares what's inside of your head unless they're paid to care
* Writing is not communicating your ideas to your readers
  * It's changing their ideas
  * Nobody cares what ideas you have
* Your work is not new or original. it's vaulable work.
  * You're not here to create new knowledge. but valuable knowledge.
* Every community has code. set of words that communicate value
  * Know the code to make your text persuasive
* Have an argument not an explanation 
* If you're challenging the community you need to do it under the code
 * There are insulting ways to do it. avoid it
* Your writing function is to help your readers understanding better something they want to understand well 
 * Reasons for writing is different than reasons for reading
 * The function is to move the conversation forward
 * The function is not to be preserved indefinitely
 * It's not to reveal what's in your head but to change the space of what's going on between your heads
* Words that create tension: however, challenge, contradiction, despite, instability, red flag, instability.
* Avoid talking about yourself, it's not about YOUR problem. 
 * the problem needs to reside on the reader side not the writer side
 * you locate a problem in a specific reading communities
 * Show that the situation is **unstable**
* Readers look for models of inconsistency to identify value
* "We have a gap in our knowledge" a polite way to say: "We're wrong" about something
 * It's huge problem for some communities to use a category that they don't understand
